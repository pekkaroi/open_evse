# OpenEVSE

My fork has support for two contactors - one for 1 phase and one for 3 phase, and user can select the relay before starting charging. Change of the relay is forbidden during charging. To change the number of phases (to match with excess solar production), I have implemented a EspHome component connected to my OpenEvse directly with uart, and it first disables the charger (sleep), changes the relay to use, and then re-enables charge.

Additionally, as I accidentially ordered AtMega 328pb chips instead of 328p for my build, I had to modify the source accordinly.

Firmware for OpenEVSE controller used in OpenEVSE Charging Stations sold in the USA, and OpenEnergyMonitor EmonEVSE units sold in (UK/EU).

- EmonEVSE: <https://shop.openenergymonitor.com/evse/>

Based on OpenEVSE: Open Source Hardware J1772 Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment

## USA

TODO: add notes about USA OpenEVSE

## UK/EU

- Disable `AUTOSVCLEVEL` (autodetection is designed for split-phase)
- Charging level default to `L2`
- Set `MAX_CURRENT_CAPACITY_L2 32` (limit for single-phase charging in UK/EU)
- Add '.EU' to version number
- Enable LCD Redraw every couple of min (required for EMC/CE)

### EmonEVSE

EmonEVSE (non-tethered type-2 EVSE unit)

- `PP_AUTO_AMPACITY` enabled to set max current based on non-tethered cable connected
- Three-phase option with `THREEPHASE` enabled to calculate three-phase energy ( Unneeded with ESP32_WiFi firmware >= 4.2

Firmware compile & upload help: [firmware/open_evse/LoadingFirmware.md](firmware/open_evse/LoadingFirmware.md)

NOTES:

- Working versions of the required libraries are included with the firmware code. This avoids potential issues related to using the wrong versions of the libraries.
- Highly recommend using the tested pre-compiled firmware (see releases page)

## Flash pre-compiled using avrdude

`$ avrdude -p atmega328p -B6 -c usbasp -P usb -e -U flash:w:firmware.hex`

ISP programmer required e.g [USBASP](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Hobby-Components-USBASP-Programmer-Adapter/dp/B06XYV162N)

### Set AVR fuses

This only needs to be done once in the factory

`avrdude -c USBasp -p m328p -U lfuse:w:0xFF:m -U hfuse:w:0xDF:m -U efuse:w:0xFD:m -B6`

If writing eFuse fails ISBasp may need a [firmware update](https://www.vishnumaiea.in/articles/electronics/how-to-solve-usbasp-avr-efuse-write-problem-on-progisp)

Tip Jar: I developed/maintain this firmware on a volunteer basis. Any donation, no matter how small, is greatly appreciated.
